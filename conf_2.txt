Add a new feature : 
    - The “Temps minimum” concept: during the “Elimination” phase only, players with a time equal to or greater than this minimum time will be directly disqualified
    - We add this "Temps minimum" in an input, like a player's simple input of time
    - The input of "Temps minimum" should be after all phases
    - This concept has to impact the overall ranking : the disqualified should not be in the overall ranking
Now we have a new concept of "Disqualified", during the “Elimination” phase, if a player has been eliminated by the "Temps minimum", he can no longer compete and will be added to the list of "Disqualified".
In the output of the last phase in the terminal, after adding the "Temps minimum", there should be a list of "Disqualified". The list of "Disqualified" should also be saved in the .txt file
