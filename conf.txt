Objective : Create a tournament management application with a Graphical User Interface(GUI)

This is a tournament where the winner is the person with the fastest time -> The time will be in the format: minutes:seconds.millisecond (02:13.58 for example)
We have 4 phases during the tournament : "Elimination", "1/4 (Quart de finale)", "1/2 (Demi finale)" and "Finale".

How the 4 phases work : 
    During the "Elimination" phase (at the beginning) :
        - You have 4 groups -> from A to D (A,B,C,D)
        - In each group, you have 4 players, so you have : 
            - in A : A1,A2,A3,A4
            - in B : B1,B2,B3,B4
            - in C : C1,C2,C3,C4
            - in D : D1,D2,D3,D4
        - In each group, the 2 players with the best times move up to the next phase
    During the "1/4 (Quart de finale)" phase (after "Elimination") : 
        - The best of group A will play against the best of group B, and the best of group C will play against the best of group D
            - For example:
                In "Elimination", the best are : 
                    Groupe A
                        - A1: 01:57.97
                        - A2: 01:59.79
                    Groupe B
                        - B3: 01:49.69
                        - B4: 01:55.25
                    Groupe C
                        - C1: 01:59.89
                        - C4: 02:02.67
                    Groupe D
                        - D2: 01:48.45
                        - D3: 01:48.77
                In "1/4 (Quart de finale)" we will have : 
                    - A1 vs B3
                    - A2 vs B4
                    - C1 vs D2
                    - C4 vs D3
        - From this phase onwards, the best of each opposition moves up to the next phase
            - If we take the previous example, we might have :
                - A1 vs B3 -> B3 
                - A2 vs B4 -> B4
                - C1 vs D2 -> C1
                - C4 vs D3 -> D3
    During the "1/2 (Demi finale)" phase (after "1/4 (Quart de finale)") : 
        - The winners of the first 2 matches of "1/4 (Quart de finale)" will face each other, and the winners of the last 2 matches of "1/4 (Quart de finale)" will face each other
            - With our example, we would have : 
                - B3 vs B4 -> B3
                - C1 vs D3 -> C1
    During the "Finale" phase, the last phase :
        - The 2 winners of the last phase will face up
        - The winner of the "Finale" will be 1st  
        - The loser of the "Finale" will be 2nd  

At the beginning of each phase : 
    - Display an insertion form like the picture I gave you (makes it beautiful)
    - Special features of the form :
        - A validation button is placed next to each insertion line
        - Once a line has been validated, it disappears
        - You have to fill in the top lines before you can fill in the bottom lines

At the end of each phase : 
    "Elimination" phase :
        - Show in the terminal (as an output) :
            - Ranking within each group
                - For example, in Group A:
                        A4 (1er)
                        A2 (2e)
                        A3 (3e)
                        A1 (4e)
        - After that, suggest moving on to the next phase with a message box 
    "1/4 (Quart de finale)" phase :
        - Show in the terminal (as an output) :
            - The winner of each confrontation :
                - For example :
                    - A1 vs B3 -> B3 
                    - A2 vs B4 -> B4
                    - C1 vs D2 -> C1
                    - C4 vs D3 -> D3
        - After that, suggest moving on to the next phase with a message box   
    "1/2 (Demi finale)" phase :
        - Show in the terminal (as an output) :
            - The winner of each confrontation :
                - For example :
                    - B3 vs B4 -> B3
                    - C1 vs D3 -> C1
        - After that, suggest moving on to the next phase with a message box   
    "Finale" phase :
        - Show in the terminal (as an output) :
            - The winner of the final confrontation : 
                - For example :
                    - B3 vs C1 -> C1
            - Overall tournament standings :
                - For example : 
                    1er : C1
                    2e : B3
                    (...) For the rest of the ranking, their rank will be based on their last time at the level of the last phase in which they were 
                        - For example, in "1/2 (Demi finale)" phase if B4 has 01:45.33 and D3 has 01:48.25 :
                            - 3e : B4
                            - 4e : D3
                    Particularity of this ranking, if players have an identical time, then their rank will be the same :
                        - For example, in "1/2 (Demi finale)" phase if B4 has 01:47.29 and D3 has 01:47.29 :
                            - 3e : B4
                            - 4e : D3
        - After that, show a message box wich says that the tournament is finished, and save in a .txt file : 
            - The Overall tournament standings 
            - The results in each of the phases
